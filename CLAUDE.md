# findajob — CLAUDE.md

Read by Claude Code at the start of every session. Authoritative context for this codebase.
Personal identifiers (name, targets, API topic, form URLs) live in `CLAUDE.local.md` (gitignored).

## Self-Governance — Check Before Every Command

Before writing any command, path, binary call, or file location:

- [ ] Python: use `sys.executable` in scripts; check `config/paths.env` for the platform path
- [ ] aichat-ng: get path from `AICHAT` in `findajob.paths` — never hardcode, never call bare `aichat`
- [ ] pandoc: get path from `PANDOC` in `findajob.paths`
- [ ] aichat-ng config dir: `~/.config/aichat_ng/`
- [ ] Roles dir: `<repo>/config/roles/` — `.md` files only, never `.yaml`
- [ ] Master resume: `candidate_context/master_resume.md` — never `config/master_resume.md` or `rag_sources/master_resume.md`
- [ ] Anthropic client in aichat-ng config: `type: claude` — never `type: anthropic`; prefix `claude:` not `anthropic:`
- [ ] RAG never passed to scorer, cover letter writer, or outreach drafter
- [ ] All binary paths come from `findajob.paths` (`src/findajob/paths.py`) — never hardcode platform paths in scripts

**If uncertain about any value: say so. Do not guess.**

---

## PII and Domain-Neutrality — HARD RULES

This repo is intended to eventually be public and useful for job seekers in any field.
**Never commit personal identifiers or field-specific hardcoded content to tracked files.**

### Never commit to tracked files
- [ ] Real names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, LinkedIn handles
- [ ] Real employer names from the user's career history
- [ ] Real certification names, project names, or internal program names from the user's history
- [ ] Specific city/region ties to the user (e.g., "based in LA")
- [ ] The user's ntfy topic, Google Form URL, or other personal service handles
- [ ] Git email addresses or usernames that contain the user's real name (handled by git config, not code)

If personal content must exist in the pipeline (e.g., name enforcement in a role prompt),
move it to a **gitignored** file such as `candidate_context/profile.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, or
`config/` (credentials), and have the tracked file reference it instead.

### Never hardcode field-specific content in tracked files
- [ ] Company lists (Meta, Google, OpenAI, etc.) — belong in `config/target_companies.md` or `config/tier1.txt` (gitignored)
- [ ] Job title patterns specific to one field (software engineer, data center operations, nurse, teacher) — belong in `config/prefilter_rules.yaml` or similar (gitignored)
- [ ] Industry vocabulary in role prompts ("NPI", "IC6", "Tier 1 company") — rewrite to reference the candidate profile
- [ ] Hard-reject categories enumerated in `config/roles/job_scorer.md` — should reference profile categories, not enumerate tech/healthcare/finance/etc. inline
- [ ] Example files (`*.example`) should show **multiple fields** or use abstract placeholders, not just tech examples

### Pre-commit hook
A local pre-commit hook at `.git/hooks/pre-commit` blocks commits containing the user's
personal identifiers. The hook is **not tracked** — each clone must install its own. See
`docs/setup/configure.md` for setup. When adding new personal identifiers (new ntfy topic,
new form URL), extend the hook's `PATTERNS` array.

### Self-check before any commit

Before staging any change to a tracked file, ask:
1. Does this introduce any personal identifier (name, employer, cert, city, email, URL)?
2. Does this hardcode any company name, job title category, or industry vocabulary?
3. Would this change make the pipeline harder to use for someone in a different field (social work, education, healthcare, finance, skilled trades)?

If YES to any: put the content in a gitignored config file and reference it from the tracked
file. If you're refactoring an old hardcoded section, add a note to `docs/GENERALIZATION.md`.

## Pipeline Context Table

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Default model | `openrouter:google/gemini-3-flash-preview` |
| Embedding model | `gemini-embed:gemini-embedding-001` — dedicated named client, never touched by `--sync-models` |
| `job_scorer` | `openrouter:deepseek/deepseek-v3.2` — profile.md injected directly; `--rag` NEVER used |
| `resume_tailor` / `cover_letter_writer` | `openrouter:anthropic/claude-opus-4.7`, `max_tokens: 4096` |
| `company_discoverer` | `openrouter:perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro` — runs weekly Sun 02:00; emits `candidate_context/discovered_companies.md` + `.json`; field-agnostic, augments static `## Target Companies` |
| `company_researcher` | `openrouter:perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro` |
| `briefing_writer` | `openrouter:anthropic/claude-opus-4.7` — cascades into `resume_tailor` + `cover_letter_writer`, both Opus 4.7 |
| `outreach_drafter` | `openrouter:anthropic/claude-opus-4.7` — profile + voice samples injected directly |
| `fit_analyst` | `openrouter:perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro` — appended to company briefing |
| `resume_change_reviewer` / `network_analyst` | `openrouter:google/gemini-3-flash-preview` |
| `recruiter_critic` | `openrouter:anthropic/claude-opus-4.7`, `max_tokens: 1024` — sees company, title, JD, tailored resume, cover; NOT profile/briefing/fit |
| `interview_prep` | `openrouter:anthropic/claude-opus-4.7`, `max_tokens: 4096` — generated on `applied → interview` board transition (not at apply time). Reads existing prep folder (briefing, tailored resume, cover, optional critique) and EXPANDS briefing's `❓ Likely Interview Questions` + `💡 Stories from Your Background` sections rather than re-deriving. Five-section output: lead-with-this opener, elevator pitch, STAR expansions, tough Qs, questions to ask. |
| `candidate_led_briefing` | `openrouter:perplexity/sonar-deep-research` — async, 1–5 min latency. Drives the speculative briefing pass for `/ingest/?mode=speculative`. Spawned as detached subprocess via `scripts/run_speculative_research.py`. |
| `speculative_roles_synth` | `openrouter:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`, `max_tokens: 4096` — synthesizes 1–5 candidate-tailored role cards from the briefing + candidate context. JSON-array output validated by `findajob.speculative.parser`. Cover letter and outreach drafts get a `<<SPECULATIVE_MODE>>` marker for synthetic rows; both role files branch on it for cold-outreach framing. |
| Job ingestion | jobs-api14 (RapidAPI) — LinkedIn only (`datePosted: 'day'`; Indeed slot dropped #274 due to 0.08% application rate); direct Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever JSON; Gmail OAuth2 (LinkedIn + Indeed alerts) |
| Package manager | `uv sync` for dev deps; `uv run` prefix for pytest/ruff/mypy/uvicorn |
| Path resolution | `src/findajob/paths.py` — reads `config/paths.env`; BASE derived from `__file__` |
| Roles dir | `config/roles/` |
| Master resume | `candidate_context/master_resume.md` |
| Profile | `candidate_context/profile.md` |
| DB | `data/pipeline.db` |
| Pre-filter | `src/findajob/scorer_prefilter.py` — Stage 1 regex hard reject, Stage 2 no-JD default |
| Board writes | `src/findajob/web/routes/board_actions.py` — every STATUS / REJECT_REASON transition is a POST handler calling `findajob.actions`. Sheet is read-only. |
| Watchdog | `scripts/watchdog.py` every 10 min — resets jobs stuck in `prep_in_progress` > 60 min. No Sheet reads. |
| RAG index | `job_search_rag` — never passed to scorer/CL/outreach |
| Scheduler | supercronic in-container (see Container Context table below; native systemd path is legacy) |
| ntfy topic | in `data/.env` as `NTFY_TOPIC`; also in `CLAUDE.local.md` |
| Google Form | URL and response sheet ID in `CLAUDE.local.md` and `config/form_responses_sheet_id.txt` |

---

## Container Context (when running from the findajob Docker image)

When the pipeline runs inside the `ghcr.io/brockamer/findajob` image, paths shift:

| Thing | Native install | Container |
|---|---|---|
| `BASE` (from `findajob.paths`) | Repo clone path | `/app` (set via `JSP_BASE=/app` in compose) |
| `data/pipeline.db` | `<repo>/data/pipeline.db` | `/app/data/pipeline.db` (bind-mounted from `./state/data/`) |
| `config/roles/` | `<repo>/config/roles/` | `/app/config/roles/` (baked into image — NOT from bind mount) |
| Personal config (`config/*.yaml|.txt|.json`) | `<repo>/config/` | `/app/config/` (bind-mounted from `./state/config/`) |
| `candidate_context/` | `<repo>/candidate_context/` | `/app/candidate_context/` (bind-mount) |
| `discovered_companies.md/.json` | `<repo>/candidate_context/discovered_companies.{md,json}` (gitignored, generated) | `/app/candidate_context/discovered_companies.{md,json}` (generated into bind-mount) |
| `companies/` | `<repo>/companies/` | `/app/companies/` (bind-mount) |
| Onboarding sentinel | `<repo>/data/.onboarding-complete` (new in #148) | `/app/data/.onboarding-complete` (bind-mount from `./state/data/`) |
| Onboarding backups | `<repo>/.backups/{UTC-stamp}/` (new in #148) | `/app/.backups/` (bind-mount from `./state/.backups/`) |
| `aichat-ng` | `/usr/local/bin/aichat-ng` | `/usr/local/bin/aichat-ng` (blob42/aichat-ng prebuilt) |
| aichat-ng config dir | `~/.config/aichat_ng/` | `/app/.config/aichat_ng/` (bind-mount from `./state/aichat_ng/`) |
| Scheduler | systemd user services | supercronic inside the container |
| Web viewer | `src/findajob/web/` (package) | uvicorn co-process on container port 8090 (mapped to `FINDAJOB_MATERIALS_PORT`) |

**When authoring new scripts or tests:**
- Always use `findajob.paths.BASE` — never hardcode `/home/...` or `/app/`.
- Binary subprocess calls go through `AICHAT`/`PANDOC` from `findajob.paths`.
- Tests must not depend on absolute paths — use tmpdirs or `BASE`-relative paths.

### Web Frontend Architecture

Lives at `src/findajob/web/`. One file per URL group in `routes/` (e.g. `routes/materials.py`, `routes/board.py`, `routes/landing.py`). Shared partials (`_nav.html`, `_job_row.html`) live in `templates/`.

Foundational decisions (from `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-21-web-frontend-14b-design.md`):
- Server-rendered HTML + HTMX (no SPA)
- Grouped URL IA — top-nav = `/`, `/board/`, `/materials/`, `/ingest/`, `/stats/`, `/tools/`, `/config/`, `/docs/`
- Tailwind via CDN + `static/app.css` design tokens
- URL query params for UI state (not cookies/localStorage)
- Alpine.js added only when ephemeral client state is needed

`/config/` is the in-browser editor for the pipeline's editable config files (profile,
master resume, prefilter rules, search queries, feed URLs, role prompts) with an
explicit allowlist. There is no per-user authorization inside findajob — anyone the
perimeter lets in can edit pipeline config. The default perimeter is Wireguard-only;
internet-exposed per-tester instances additionally gate the entire web UI behind HTTP
Basic Auth via the `FINDAJOB_AUTH_USER` / `FINDAJOB_AUTH_PASS` env vars (see
`findajob.web.auth` and `docs/setup/internet-exposure.md` (#327)). See
`findajob.web.config_files` for the `/config/` allowlist definition (#149).

`/onboarding/` is the first-run NUX + paste-back injector for the interview
emitted by `config/roles/onboarding_interviewer.md`. A FastAPI dependency on
the `/board/*`, `/materials/*`, and `/stats/*` router includes redirects to
`/onboarding/` when `{base_root}/data/.onboarding-complete` is missing. The
paste-back injector writes ten canonical config files (under
`candidate_context/`, `config/`, and `data/`) plus a derived
`config/companies_of_interest.txt`, and backs up any existing destinations
to `{base_root}/.backups/{UTC-stamp}/` first. Re-triggerable from `/tools/`
via `/onboarding/?mode=rerun`. See
`findajob.onboarding.parser`/`findajob.onboarding.injector`/
`findajob.web.onboarding_guard` for the implementation boundaries (#148).

The original seven were profile.md, master_resume.md, target_companies.md,
business_sector_employers_reference.md, jsearch_queries.txt,
prefilter_rules.yaml, in_domain_patterns.yaml. #328 added three more:
`candidate_context/display_name.txt` (for deterministic materials-filename
prefix derivation), `data/timezone` (single-line IANA tz; operator must
reflect in `compose.yaml`'s `TZ` env var to take effect), and a parsed
`ntfy_topic.txt` whose value is merged into `data/.env` as `NTFY_TOPIC=...`
(merge preserves any unrelated keys like `RAPIDAPI_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
across the write). Plus the user's **OpenRouter API key**, collected via a
dedicated form field on the `/onboarding/` page rather than the emission
blob (kept out of the user's chat-LLM logs by design); merged into
`data/.env` as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...`. Before writing the sentinel, the
injector verifies the key with a 1-token completion against
`google/gemini-3-flash-preview` via OpenRouter
(`findajob.onboarding.openrouter_smoke.verify_openrouter_key`); failure
raises `OnboardingSmokeCheckFailed`, and the route renders the error
verbatim — files are committed but the sentinel is NOT written, so the
next paste-back overwrites cleanly with a corrected key.

The interview also accepts an **optional eighth file** — `voice-samples.md`
— containing the user's pasted long-form prose for cover-letter and outreach
voice calibration. When provided, the injector runs the body through
`findajob.onboarding.voice_processor.process_voice_samples` (deterministic
markdown-strip pass + Opus 4.7 PII-generalization pass) before atomically
writing to `candidate_context/voice_samples/voice-samples.md`. Absent or
empty voice samples → the file is never created and the pipeline falls
back to resume-based voice calibration with no error (#262).

`/docs/` renders the user-facing guides (`docs/usage.md`,
`docs/troubleshooting.md`, `docs/setup/README.md` + setup sub-pages) inline
in the web UI so operators don't have to leave the app for help. Slug → file
allowlist in `findajob.web.routes.docs`; Markdown rendering is the shared
`render_markdown()` helper in `findajob.web.markdown`, which also handles
`.md` cross-link rewriting (`[usage.md](usage.md)` → `/docs/usage`) and
`target="_blank"` on external links. The markdown files on disk under `docs/`
remain the source of truth; GitHub rendering is unchanged (#224).

### Per-column filter framework

All board tabs use a single declarative filter framework under
`findajob.web.filters`. Each tab declares a `tuple[ColumnSpec, ...]`
in `findajob.web.filters.registry`; the framework parses URL params
into `ParsedFilters`, builds parameterized SQL clauses via
`build_filter_clauses()`, and renders header inputs + popovers via
shared partials (`_table_header.html`, `_active_filters.html`).

URL contract is flat with type-suffixed param names:
- TEXT: `?col=substring` (case-insensitive contains)
- SCORE / INTEGER: `?col_min=&col_max=`
- ENUM: `?col=a,b,c` (multi-select via comma)
- DATE: `?col_from=&col_to=`
- Sort: `?sort=col&desc=1` (existing convention preserved)
- Visibility: `?cols=a,b,c` (explicit replacement set; default per spec)

State cascade: URL querystring > ColumnSpec.default_visible. Persisted
per-tab prefs are #277 — the cascade has the layer hook.

When adding a new board tab, declare its ColumnSpec list in
`registry.py`, add a base WHERE constant + `_<tab>_query()` builder
in `routes/board.py`, and create the tab template that includes
`_filters.html` + `_table_header.html`. No per-tab filter code needed.

## Critical Architecture Rules

### Web is the Write Surface
Every STATUS and REJECT_REASON transition runs through a POST handler in
`findajob.web.routes.board_actions` that calls straight into
`findajob.actions`. The Google Sheet is a one-way synced view (DB → Sheet);
`sync_sheet.py` never reads from Sheets. Do not add new transition logic to
`watchdog.py` or to any Sheet-reading path — every new action is a new web
handler + a new `findajob.actions` helper.

Some transitions also spawn detached generator subprocesses:
- `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/prep` and `/regenerate` → `scripts/prep_application.py` (briefing, tailored resume, cover, recruiter critique, outreach drafts)
- `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/interview` → `scripts/interview_prep.py` (interview prep artifact). Always (re)launches on each click — re-clicking is the regenerate mechanism after a recruiter sends panel info; a sentinel file `.interview_prep_in_progress` in the prep folder guards against concurrent runs.
- `POST /ingest/speculative` and `POST /speculative/regenerate/{id}` → `scripts/run_speculative_research.py` (briefing + role-synth pipeline). Async — status page polls `/speculative/status/{id}/poll` every 5s until `status='ready_for_review'`. See #131 / `findajob.web.routes.speculative` for the full route surface (POST `/ingest/speculative`, GET `/speculative/status/{id}` + `/poll`, GET `/speculative/review/{id}`, POST `/speculative/{approve,regenerate,trash}/{id}`).
- `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/apply` is synthetic-aware: reads `jobs.synthetic` and writes `audit_log.changed_by='outreach_button'` for synthetic rows (label flips to "Sent Outreach" on the dashboard); otherwise the existing `'user'` value. No separate route — single endpoint, server-derived signal.

### Path Resolution
All binary paths (AICHAT, PANDOC) come from `findajob.paths` (`src/findajob/paths.py`), which reads `config/paths.env`.
Never hardcode platform paths in scripts. `BASE` is derived from `__file__` — the repo can live anywhere.
For subprocess calls to other pipeline scripts, always use `sys.executable`, not a hardcoded Python path.
Library code lives in `src/findajob/` (installed via `pip install -e .`). Entry point scripts in `scripts/` import via `from findajob.* import ...`. No `sys.path.insert` hacks.

### RAG Policy
RAG (`--rag job_search_rag`) is NEVER passed to `job_scorer`, `cover_letter_writer`,
`outreach_drafter`, or any role needing candidate-specific context. RAG chunking drops
contact info, employer names, and dates. All candidate context injected directly via
`candidate_context/profile.md` and `candidate_context/master_resume.md` string interpolation.
RAG indexes `candidate_context/` but is used only in REPL mode.

### Hard Rejects are Code
`scorer_prefilter.py` handles hard rejects deterministically before any LLM call.
Stage 1: title regex → score 1, no LLM. Stage 2: in-domain + no JD → score 5/6, no LLM.
Never rely on LLM prompt instructions alone for boolean classification tasks.

### Synthetic Jobs Convention (Speculative Cold-Outreach)

Some `jobs` rows are *synthetic* — produced by the speculative ingest path
(`/ingest/` "Speculative" tab, see #131) for cold-outreach to companies
that aren't currently posting a matching opening. Two new role files drive
synthesis: `candidate_led_briefing` (Perplexity Sonar Deep Research) for
the briefing, and `speculative_roles_synth` (Claude Sonnet 4.6) for the
1–5 candidate-tailored role cards. Pre-approval state lives in
`speculative_requests`; only on operator approve do `jobs` rows get
written by `findajob.speculative.approver`.

**Marker on jobs row:** `synthetic=1` (canonical) + `source='web_speculative'` +
`[SPEC] ` title prefix. The `[SPEC] ` prefix is two-layer defense (literal
in `jobs.title` so it flows through every render path; render-time SPEC
badge in `_job_row.html` for visual differentiation); the `synthetic` flag
is the canonical data-layer signal.

**Lifecycle invariants enforced in code:**
- `findajob.actions.handle_rejection` SKIPS `feedback_log` writes when
  `jobs.synthetic=1`. Synthetic rejections must never feed the scorer.
  (`handle_not_selected` already does not write to `feedback_log`.)
- `findajob.scoring._build_feedback_block` LEFT JOINs to `jobs` and
  excludes `synthetic=1` rows from the scorer prompt's rejection history.
- Speculative rows reuse the `applied` stage (no new enum value). The
  `/board/jobs/{fp}/apply` handler reads `jobs.synthetic` and writes
  `audit_log.changed_by='outreach_button'` for synthetic rows; otherwise
  `'user'`. Apply-gate query is unchanged
  (`field_changed='stage' AND new_value='applied'`) — cold-outreach counts.
- `scripts/prep_application.py` and `scripts/find_contacts.py` prepend a
  `<<SPECULATIVE_MODE>>` marker to the cover-letter and outreach prompts
  when `jobs.synthetic=1`; both role files branch on the marker for
  cold-outreach framing.
- `scripts/watchdog.py` `fail_stuck_speculative()` flips any
  `speculative_requests` row stuck in `status='researching'` for >10 min
  to `status='failed'`. Covers the silent-subprocess-death case.
- `scripts/prep_application.py` reuses the deep-research briefing from
  `companies/{folder}/briefing.md` when `jobs.speculative_briefing_folder`
  is set — skips `company_researcher` + `briefing_writer` entirely (#320).
  Falls back to the regular `briefing_writer` flow if the column is unset,
  the folder is missing, or briefing.md is empty/whitespace-only. The
  approver (`findajob.speculative.approver`) populates the column from
  `speculative_requests.briefing_folder` at approve time so each per-role
  prep folder references the same submission-time briefing.

**Folder layout:**
- Briefing folder: `companies/{Company}_SPECULATIVE_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HHMMSS}/briefing.md`
- Per-role prep folder (created on flag-for-prep): same convention as
  real prep folders.

**Endpoints:** see "Web Is The Write Surface" below.

Full spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-28-speculative-ingest-131-design.md`.

### Abbreviation Clarifications
Any internally-branded teams, programs, or org names with ambiguous abbreviations must be
spelled out explicitly in role prompts and CLAUDE.local.md. LLMs will misinterpret
abbreviations if context is not given. See CLAUDE.local.md for this installation's specifics.

### Company Discovery is a Parallel Signal
`config/roles/company_discoverer.md` runs weekly via supercronic and after
onboarding completion. It emits `candidate_context/discovered_companies.md`
+ `.json` (gitignored). Both are read by #285's scorer rewire and #283's
Greenhouse-slug derivation as INPUTS, not floors. The static
`## Target Companies / Organizations` section in profile.md remains as a
strategic-preference signal — orthogonal to the competency-fit signal the
discoverer produces. Do not delete the static list to "consolidate" — they
serve different purposes.

### Output Folder Format
`{Company}_{AbbrevTitle}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HHMMSS}` — title abbreviated to first 3 words, underscored.
The HHMMSS suffix is required to prevent same-day overwrites.
`abbrev_title()` is defined in `prep_application.py` and `rename_folders.py`.

Speculative briefings use a parallel convention:
`{Company}_SPECULATIVE_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HHMMSS}/briefing.md` — see
`findajob.speculative.storage.speculative_folder_name`. The literal
`SPECULATIVE` token replaces the abbreviated title since there's no
specific posting at submission time.

### JD at Prep Time
`prep_application.py` reads JD from the database. Never re-curls the URL at prep time.

### company_match() Blank String Guard
`connections.csv` may have blank-company rows. `'' in 'anything'` is True in Python.
Every `company_match()` function must guard: `if not s or not c: return False`

### Title/Company Cleaning
API title and company fields contain appended metadata (location, salary, recency flags).
`clean_title()` and `clean_company()` must be applied at every ingest path before storing.

### Two-Tier Dedup
Ingest runs two tiers. **Tier 1** is the strict `fingerprint(title, company, location)` hash;
**Tier 2** is `loose_fingerprint(title, company)`, checked only when the incoming row OR any
existing same-(company, title) row has a coarse location (empty, country-only, or bare
"Remote"). This dedupes cross-source syndication (Greenhouse "US" vs LinkedIn "Barstow, TX")
while keeping genuinely distinct-city reqs (site managers in different cities) as separate
rows. All location comparisons route through `normalize_location()`, which strips
`(On-site)`/`(Remote)`/`(Hybrid)` suffixes and trailing country codes. Both `scripts/triage.py`
and `scripts/ingest_form.py` use the centralized helpers from `findajob.cleaning` — do not
reintroduce drifted local `_normalize`/`fingerprint` copies.

### LinkedIn JD Fetch
Direct curl to LinkedIn always returns auth wall. Always use RapidAPI `/v2/linkedin/get?id=`.
This applies to both `linkedin_jobsapi` and `gmail_linkedin` sources.

### LinkedIn Query Format
`jsearch_queries.txt`: 3-4 word natural phrases only. Keyword-heavy strings (5+ words)
return zero LinkedIn results. Validate each query manually before committing.

### Google Sheet Architecture

> **Web UI is the write surface.** As of #61 PR-B, `sync_sheet.py` writes DB
> state to the Sheet one-way and never reads from it. Operators drive every
> STATUS + REJECT_REASON transition through `/board/*`. As of #62 (14d), the
> `/ingest/` web form replaces the Google Form + `ingest_form.py` poll loop.
> The Sheet remains a read-only synced view for mobile/glance use until
> `sync_sheet.py` itself is retired — the remaining step under the parent #14.

**Dashboard** — pre-application queue (A–N), filter: `(score>=7 AND stage IN (scored,manual_review))` OR `stage IN (prep_in_progress, materials_drafted)`. Row columns:
`STATUS(dropdown) | REJECT_REASON(dropdown) | fingerprint(hidden) | fit_score | probability_score | relevance_score | title(hyperlink) | company | location | remote | contacts | comp | notes | date`

**Applied** — post-application queue (A–N), filter: `stage IN (applied, interview, offer)`.
`STATUS(dropdown) | REJECT_REASON(dropdown) | fingerprint(hidden) | title(hyperlink) | company(viewer hyperlink) | applied_date | days_since_applied(formula) | stage | user_notes | known_contacts | location | remote | comp | ai_notes`
- `STATUS` options (col A): `Interviewing` / `Offer` / `Not Selected` / `Withdrew`
- `days_since_applied` = live `=IF(F2="","",TODAY()-F2)` formula — no re-sync needed
- Row color by priority: Offer→gold, Interviewing→purple, >=21d→gray (silent = likely ghosted), 14–20d→red, 7–13d→yellow, 0–6d→green
- `user_notes` (col I) is free-text; edited via the web `/board/applied` notes input, one-way synced to Sheet on the next `sync_sheet.py` pass
- `applied_date` sourced from `audit_log` where `new_value='applied'` (first transition)

**Review** — manual review triage (A–H), filter: `stage=manual_review`:
`STATUS(dropdown:Promote) | REJECT_REASON(dropdown) | fingerprint(hidden) | title(hyperlink) | company | score_flag_reason | source | date`

**Waitlist** — deferred jobs (A–K), filter: `stage=waitlisted`:
`STATUS(dropdown:Reactivate) | REJECT_REASON(dropdown) | fingerprint(hidden) | title(hyperlink) | company | relevance_score | location | remote | ai_notes | date | blocking_app`
- `blocking_app` = computed at sync time: title + stage of active application at same company

**Write surface — `findajob.web.routes.board_actions`:**

Every transition is a POST handler that calls straight into `findajob.actions`
(handle_rejection, handle_not_selected, handle_waitlist, handle_reactivate,
promote_to_scored, notify_waitlist_resurface, reset_prep_to_scored) and
responds in the same request. No poll cycle, no Sheet readback.

| Action | Endpoint | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Flag for Prep | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/prep` | Dashboard dropdown |
| Regenerate | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/regenerate` | Dashboard dropdown |
| Applied | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/apply` | Dashboard dropdown |
| Waitlist | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/waitlist` | Dashboard dropdown |
| Reject (w/ reason) | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/reject` | Dashboard / Review / Waitlist reject cell |
| Interviewing | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/interview` | Applied dropdown |
| Offer | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/offer` | Applied dropdown |
| Withdrew | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/withdraw` | Applied dropdown |
| Not Selected (w/ reason) | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/not-selected` | Applied dropdown + reject cell |
| Promote | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/promote` | Review button |
| Reactivate | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/reactivate` | Waitlist button |
| Edit user_notes | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/notes` | Applied notes input (800ms debounce) |

**REJECT_REASON dropdown**: 11 options (includes "Low Fit Score"). Behavior depends on STATUS:
- If STATUS = `Not Selected`: company rejection → `stage=not_selected`, NO `feedback_log`, folder stays in `_applied/` with `NOT_SELECTED_` marker file
- Otherwise: user rejection → `stage=rejected`, writes `feedback_log`, moves folder to `_rejected/`

**Stage `waitlisted`:** Set by `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/waitlist`. Folder moves to `companies/_waitlisted/`. Not a rejection — does not write to feedback_log or contaminate scorer feedback loop. When an active application at the same company is rejected/withdrawn, ntfy notification surfaces waitlisted jobs.

**Stage `not_selected`:** Set by `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/not-selected`. Only valid for post-application stages (`applied`, `interview`, `offer`); 409 otherwise. Folder stays in `companies/_applied/` with a `NOT_SELECTED_{reason}_{date}.txt` marker file. Does NOT write to `feedback_log` — company rejections must not contaminate the scorer's feedback loop. `notify_waitlist_resurface()` still fires. Appears on the Rejected Applications tab alongside user rejections.

**Stage `prep_in_progress`:** Set by `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/prep` immediately before launching `prep_application.py` as a subprocess. Prevents duplicate prep runs (handler idempotency guard + 3-job concurrency cap). Cleared to `materials_drafted` on success. `scripts/watchdog.py` rolls any job stuck > 60 min back to `scored` so the operator can re-flag.

**Health checks** (`notify.py health-check`): warns if manual_review backlog > 100, a source silently stopped producing jobs, or any target-company job scored 3–6 in last 7 days (potential mis-scores).

## Project Board — Single Source of Truth

All work is tracked on the GitHub Project board at https://github.com/users/brockamer/projects/1. **Not on the board = not on the roadmap.** No markdown tracking files, no TODO lists.

Canonical conventions live in [`docs/project-board.md`](docs/project-board.md). Read it before any work that creates, moves, or reprioritizes issues. That doc covers columns, Priority field, labels, triage checklist, and `gh project` CLI IDs.

Core rules (enforced — see the doc for detail):
- Creating an issue is **two steps**: `gh issue create` then `gh project item-add 1 --owner brockamer --url <url>`. New issues do not auto-add.
- Every open issue on the board must have **Priority** (High/Medium/Low) set.
- Speculative far-horizon ideas get the `big-idea` label and Priority: Low — keeps them on the board without cluttering the active roadmap.
- `priority: high/med/low` labels are legacy — the **Priority field** is canonical. Reconcile mismatches.
- In Progress should hold 1–3 items max. If more, focus is scattered.
- Status transitions: Backlog → Up Next → In Progress → Done. Closing an issue auto-moves to Done; verify after closing.
- Re-sync board state before changing it — other sessions may have updated it.

**When board usage evolves** (new column, new label, new workflow, new convention): update `docs/project-board.md` in the same change. The doc describes how the board actually works, not how it used to work. Behavior drifting ahead of docs is the main failure mode.

---

## Plan Conventions

Implementation plans live in `docs/superpowers/plans/`. Conventions are documented in [`docs/plan-conventions.md`](docs/plan-conventions.md).

**Hard requirements for every plan:**
- Numbered tasks with files, steps, verification commands, commit messages
- A **Documentation Impact** section enumerating every doc surface that needs to change (README, docs/setup/*, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, spec doc, docstrings). If none, say "None" — never omit the section
- A whole-feature verification gate distinct from per-task checks
- A self-review checklist mapping every spec section to its implementing task(s)

A plan without Documentation Impact is incomplete — push back rather than execute it.

## Release Management

Docker image releases follow [`docs/release-process.md`](docs/release-process.md). Claude owns orchestration (dogfood gate, CHANGELOG drafting, tag cut, post-tag verification, rollback); the user reviews and approves the proposed cut. The dogfood gate is a binary 48h window on `:latest` — six observable signals must all be clean before any `v*.*.*` tag is pushed. PRs containing schema/config/crontab/mount/compose-down changes get the `migration-required` label at PR-open time so that release notes surface them for external users.

---

## Commit Flow

This is a solo repo. Default to committing directly to `main`. Use feature branches + PRs only when the change needs the review/CI/release-notes scaffolding.

| Change type | Flow |
|-------------|------|
| Docs, board conventions, plan/spec files, jared skill tweaks, comment edits | Commit to `main` |
| Code touching pipeline behavior (scoring, fetchers, sheet sync, DB schema, LLM roles) | Feature branch → PR → merge |
| Anything qualifying for `migration-required` (schema, config, compose, crontab, mounts) | PR — release-notes workflow depends on it |

Rationale: PRs exist to gate risky changes and to give the `migration-required` → release-notes pipeline something to attach to. A board-chore or docs-tweak PR is overhead without those benefits, and unmerged PRs cause drift (forgotten branches, misleading "merged in #N" references).

When in doubt — does this change affect what users see when they pull `:latest`? If yes, PR. If no, commit to main.

## Working Style

- Terse. User reports completion of each step before asking what's next.
- Read file contents before proposing changes. Never assume files match prior discussion.
- Diagnose root cause before fixing. No shotgun solutions.
- Copy-pasteable commands only. No placeholders. Use paths from `scripts/paths.py`. Platform-aware.
- Never confuse `aichat` with `aichat-ng`. Different binaries.
- Goal: working features first, polish later.
- Preserve the scheduler-driven daily run in all changes.
