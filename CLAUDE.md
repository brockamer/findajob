# findajob — CLAUDE.md

Read by Claude Code at the start of every session. Authoritative context for this codebase.
Personal identifiers (name, targets, API topic, form URLs) live in `CLAUDE.local.md` (gitignored).

## Self-Governance — Check Before Every Command

Before writing any command, path, binary call, or file location:

- [ ] Python: use `sys.executable` in scripts; check `config/paths.env` for the platform path
- [ ] aichat-ng: get path from `AICHAT` in `findajob.paths` — never hardcode, never call bare `aichat`
- [ ] pandoc: get path from `PANDOC` in `findajob.paths`
- [ ] aichat-ng config dir: `~/.config/aichat_ng/`
- [ ] Roles dir: `<repo>/config/roles/` — `.md` files only, never `.yaml`
- [ ] Master resume: `candidate_context/master_resume.md` — never `config/master_resume.md` or `rag_sources/master_resume.md`
- [ ] Anthropic client in aichat-ng config: `type: claude` — never `type: anthropic`; prefix `claude:` not `anthropic:`
- [ ] RAG never passed to scorer, cover letter writer, or outreach drafter
- [ ] All binary paths come from `findajob.paths` (`src/findajob/paths.py`) — never hardcode platform paths in scripts

**If uncertain about any value: say so. Do not guess.**

---

## PII and Domain-Neutrality — HARD RULES

This repo is intended to eventually be public and useful for job seekers in any field.
**Never commit personal identifiers or field-specific hardcoded content to tracked files.**

### Never commit to tracked files
- [ ] Real names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, LinkedIn handles
- [ ] Real employer names from the user's career history
- [ ] Real certification names, project names, or internal program names from the user's history
- [ ] Specific city/region ties to the user (e.g., "based in LA")
- [ ] The user's ntfy topic, Google Form URL, or other personal service handles
- [ ] Git email addresses or usernames that contain the user's real name (handled by git config, not code)

If personal content must exist in the pipeline (e.g., name enforcement in a role prompt),
move it to a **gitignored** file such as `candidate_context/profile.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, or
`config/` (credentials), and have the tracked file reference it instead.

### Never hardcode field-specific content in tracked files
- [ ] Company lists (Meta, Google, OpenAI, etc.) — belong in `config/target_companies.md` or `config/tier1.txt` (gitignored)
- [ ] Job title patterns specific to one field (software engineer, data center operations, nurse, teacher) — belong in `config/prefilter_rules.yaml` or similar (gitignored)
- [ ] Industry vocabulary in role prompts ("NPI", "IC6", "Tier 1 company") — rewrite to reference the candidate profile
- [ ] Hard-reject categories enumerated in `config/roles/job_scorer.md` — should reference profile categories, not enumerate tech/healthcare/finance/etc. inline
- [ ] Example files (`*.example`) should show **multiple fields** or use abstract placeholders, not just tech examples

### Pre-commit hook
A local pre-commit hook at `.git/hooks/pre-commit` blocks commits containing the user's
personal identifiers. The hook is **not tracked** — each clone must install its own. See
`docs/setup/configure.md` for setup. When adding new personal identifiers (new ntfy topic,
new form URL), extend the hook's `PATTERNS` array.

### Self-check before any commit

Before staging any change to a tracked file, ask:
1. Does this introduce any personal identifier (name, employer, cert, city, email, URL)?
2. Does this hardcode any company name, job title category, or industry vocabulary?
3. Would this change make the pipeline harder to use for someone in a different field (social work, education, healthcare, finance, skilled trades)?

If YES to any: put the content in a gitignored config file and reference it from the tracked
file. If you're refactoring an old hardcoded section, add a note to `docs/GENERALIZATION.md`.

## Container Context (when running from the findajob Docker image)

When the pipeline runs inside the `ghcr.io/brockamer/findajob` image, paths shift:

| Thing | Native install | Container |
|---|---|---|
| `BASE` (from `findajob.paths`) | Repo clone path | `/app` (set via `JSP_BASE=/app` in compose) |
| `data/pipeline.db` | `<repo>/data/pipeline.db` | `/app/data/pipeline.db` (bind-mounted from `./state/data/`) |
| `config/roles/` | `<repo>/config/roles/` | `/app/config/roles/` (baked into image — NOT from bind mount) |
| Personal config (`config/*.yaml|.txt|.json`) | `<repo>/config/` | `/app/config/` (bind-mounted from `./state/config/`) |
| `candidate_context/` | `<repo>/candidate_context/` | `/app/candidate_context/` (bind-mount) |
| `companies/` | `<repo>/companies/` | `/app/companies/` (bind-mount) |
| Onboarding sentinel | `<repo>/data/.onboarding-complete` (new in #148) | `/app/data/.onboarding-complete` (bind-mount from `./state/data/`) |
| Onboarding backups | `<repo>/.backups/{UTC-stamp}/` (new in #148) | `/app/.backups/` (bind-mount from `./state/.backups/`) |
| `aichat-ng` | `/usr/local/bin/aichat-ng` | `/usr/local/bin/aichat-ng` (blob42/aichat-ng prebuilt) |
| aichat-ng config dir | `~/.config/aichat_ng/` | `/app/.config/aichat_ng/` (bind-mount from `./state/aichat_ng/`) |
| Scheduler | systemd user services | supercronic inside the container |
| Web viewer | `src/findajob/web/` (package) | uvicorn co-process on container port 8090 (mapped to `FINDAJOB_MATERIALS_PORT`) |

**When authoring new scripts or tests:**
- Always use `findajob.paths.BASE` — never hardcode `/home/...` or `/app/`.
- Binary subprocess calls go through `AICHAT`/`PANDOC` from `findajob.paths`.
- Tests must not depend on absolute paths — use tmpdirs or `BASE`-relative paths.

### Web Frontend Architecture

Lives at `src/findajob/web/`. One file per URL group in `routes/` (e.g. `routes/materials.py`, `routes/board.py`, `routes/landing.py`). Shared partials (`_nav.html`, `_job_row.html`) live in `templates/`.

Foundational decisions (from `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-21-web-frontend-14b-design.md`):
- Server-rendered HTML + HTMX (no SPA)
- Grouped URL IA — top-nav = `/`, `/board/`, `/materials/`, `/ingest/`, `/stats/`, `/tools/`, `/config/`, `/docs/`
- Tailwind via CDN + `static/app.css` design tokens
- URL query params for UI state (not cookies/localStorage)
- Alpine.js added only when ephemeral client state is needed

`/config/` is the in-browser editor for the pipeline's editable config files (profile,
master resume, prefilter rules, search queries, feed URLs, role prompts) with an
explicit allowlist; no auth, consistent with the Wireguard perimeter model. See
`findajob.web.config_files` for the allowlist definition (#149).

`/onboarding/` is the first-run NUX + paste-back injector for the interview
emitted by `config/roles/onboarding_interviewer.md`. A FastAPI dependency on
the `/board/*`, `/materials/*`, and `/stats/*` router includes redirects to
`/onboarding/` when `{base_root}/data/.onboarding-complete` is missing. The
paste-back injector writes seven canonical config files (under
`candidate_context/` and `config/`) plus a derived
`config/companies_of_interest.txt`, and backs up any existing destinations
to `{base_root}/.backups/{UTC-stamp}/` first. Re-triggerable from `/tools/`
via `/onboarding/?mode=rerun`. See
`findajob.onboarding.parser`/`findajob.onboarding.injector`/
`findajob.web.onboarding_guard` for the implementation boundaries (#148).

The interview also accepts an **optional eighth file** — `voice-samples.md`
— containing the user's pasted long-form prose for cover-letter and outreach
voice calibration. When provided, the injector runs the body through
`findajob.onboarding.voice_processor.process_voice_samples` (deterministic
markdown-strip pass + Opus 4.7 PII-generalization pass) before atomically
writing to `candidate_context/voice_samples/voice-samples.md`. Absent or
empty voice samples → the file is never created and the pipeline falls
back to resume-based voice calibration with no error (#262).

`/docs/` renders the user-facing guides (`docs/usage.md`,
`docs/troubleshooting.md`, `docs/setup/README.md` + setup sub-pages) inline
in the web UI so operators don't have to leave the app for help. Slug → file
allowlist in `findajob.web.routes.docs`; Markdown rendering is the shared
`render_markdown()` helper in `findajob.web.markdown`, which also handles
`.md` cross-link rewriting (`[usage.md](usage.md)` → `/docs/usage`) and
`target="_blank"` on external links. The markdown files on disk under `docs/`
remain the source of truth; GitHub rendering is unchanged (#224).

## Critical Architecture Rules

### Web is the Write Surface
Every STATUS and REJECT_REASON transition runs through a POST handler in
`findajob.web.routes.board_actions` that calls straight into
`findajob.actions`. The Google Sheet is a one-way synced view (DB → Sheet);
`sync_sheet.py` never reads from Sheets. Do not add new transition logic to
`watchdog.py` or to any Sheet-reading path — every new action is a new web
handler + a new `findajob.actions` helper.

### Path Resolution
All binary paths (AICHAT, PANDOC) come from `findajob.paths` (`src/findajob/paths.py`), which reads `config/paths.env`.
Never hardcode platform paths in scripts. `BASE` is derived from `__file__` — the repo can live anywhere.
For subprocess calls to other pipeline scripts, always use `sys.executable`, not a hardcoded Python path.
Library code lives in `src/findajob/` (installed via `pip install -e .`). Entry point scripts in `scripts/` import via `from findajob.* import ...`. No `sys.path.insert` hacks.

### RAG Policy
RAG (`--rag job_search_rag`) is NEVER passed to `job_scorer`, `cover_letter_writer`,
`outreach_drafter`, or any role needing candidate-specific context. RAG chunking drops
contact info, employer names, and dates. All candidate context injected directly via
`candidate_context/profile.md` and `candidate_context/master_resume.md` string interpolation.
RAG indexes `candidate_context/` but is used only in REPL mode.

### Hard Rejects are Code
`scorer_prefilter.py` handles hard rejects deterministically before any LLM call.
Stage 1: title regex → score 1, no LLM. Stage 2: in-domain + no JD → score 5/6, no LLM.
Never rely on LLM prompt instructions alone for boolean classification tasks.

### Abbreviation Clarifications
Any internally-branded teams, programs, or org names with ambiguous abbreviations must be
spelled out explicitly in role prompts and CLAUDE.local.md. LLMs will misinterpret
abbreviations if context is not given. See CLAUDE.local.md for this installation's specifics.

### Output Folder Format
`{Company}_{AbbrevTitle}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HHMMSS}` — title abbreviated to first 3 words, underscored.
The HHMMSS suffix is required to prevent same-day overwrites.
`abbrev_title()` is defined in `prep_application.py` and `rename_folders.py`.

### JD at Prep Time
`prep_application.py` reads JD from the database. Never re-curls the URL at prep time.

### company_match() Blank String Guard
`connections.csv` may have blank-company rows. `'' in 'anything'` is True in Python.
Every `company_match()` function must guard: `if not s or not c: return False`

### Title/Company Cleaning
API title and company fields contain appended metadata (location, salary, recency flags).
`clean_title()` and `clean_company()` must be applied at every ingest path before storing.

### Two-Tier Dedup
Ingest runs two tiers. **Tier 1** is the strict `fingerprint(title, company, location)` hash;
**Tier 2** is `loose_fingerprint(title, company)`, checked only when the incoming row OR any
existing same-(company, title) row has a coarse location (empty, country-only, or bare
"Remote"). This dedupes cross-source syndication (Greenhouse "US" vs LinkedIn "Barstow, TX")
while keeping genuinely distinct-city reqs (site managers in different cities) as separate
rows. All location comparisons route through `normalize_location()`, which strips
`(On-site)`/`(Remote)`/`(Hybrid)` suffixes and trailing country codes. Both `scripts/triage.py`
and `scripts/ingest_form.py` use the centralized helpers from `findajob.cleaning` — do not
reintroduce drifted local `_normalize`/`fingerprint` copies.

### LinkedIn JD Fetch
Direct curl to LinkedIn always returns auth wall. Always use RapidAPI `/v2/linkedin/get?id=`.
This applies to both `linkedin_jobsapi` and `gmail_linkedin` sources.

### LinkedIn Query Format
`jsearch_queries.txt`: 3-4 word natural phrases only. Keyword-heavy strings (5+ words)
return zero LinkedIn results. Validate each query manually before committing.

### Google Sheet Architecture

> **Web UI is the write surface.** As of #61 PR-B, `sync_sheet.py` writes DB
> state to the Sheet one-way and never reads from it. Operators drive every
> STATUS + REJECT_REASON transition through `/board/*`. As of #62 (14d), the
> `/ingest/` web form replaces the Google Form + `ingest_form.py` poll loop.
> The Sheet remains a read-only synced view for mobile/glance use until
> `sync_sheet.py` itself is retired — the remaining step under the parent #14.

**Dashboard** — pre-application queue (A–N), filter: `(score>=7 AND stage IN (scored,manual_review))` OR `stage IN (prep_in_progress, materials_drafted)`. Row columns:
`STATUS(dropdown) | REJECT_REASON(dropdown) | fingerprint(hidden) | fit_score | probability_score | relevance_score | title(hyperlink) | company | location | remote | contacts | comp | notes | date`

**Applied** — post-application queue (A–N), filter: `stage IN (applied, interview, offer)`.
`STATUS(dropdown) | REJECT_REASON(dropdown) | fingerprint(hidden) | title(hyperlink) | company(viewer hyperlink) | applied_date | days_since_applied(formula) | stage | user_notes | known_contacts | location | remote | comp | ai_notes`
- `STATUS` options (col A): `Interviewing` / `Offer` / `Not Selected` / `Withdrew`
- `days_since_applied` = live `=IF(F2="","",TODAY()-F2)` formula — no re-sync needed
- Row color by priority: Offer→gold, Interviewing→purple, >=21d→gray (silent = likely ghosted), 14–20d→red, 7–13d→yellow, 0–6d→green
- `user_notes` (col I) is free-text; edited via the web `/board/applied` notes input, one-way synced to Sheet on the next `sync_sheet.py` pass
- `applied_date` sourced from `audit_log` where `new_value='applied'` (first transition)

**Review** — manual review triage (A–H), filter: `stage=manual_review`:
`STATUS(dropdown:Promote) | REJECT_REASON(dropdown) | fingerprint(hidden) | title(hyperlink) | company | score_flag_reason | source | date`

**Waitlist** — deferred jobs (A–K), filter: `stage=waitlisted`:
`STATUS(dropdown:Reactivate) | REJECT_REASON(dropdown) | fingerprint(hidden) | title(hyperlink) | company | relevance_score | location | remote | ai_notes | date | blocking_app`
- `blocking_app` = computed at sync time: title + stage of active application at same company

**Write surface — `findajob.web.routes.board_actions`:**

Every transition is a POST handler that calls straight into `findajob.actions`
(handle_rejection, handle_not_selected, handle_waitlist, handle_reactivate,
promote_to_scored, notify_waitlist_resurface, reset_prep_to_scored) and
responds in the same request. No poll cycle, no Sheet readback.

| Action | Endpoint | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Flag for Prep | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/prep` | Dashboard dropdown |
| Regenerate | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/regenerate` | Dashboard dropdown |
| Applied | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/apply` | Dashboard dropdown |
| Waitlist | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/waitlist` | Dashboard dropdown |
| Reject (w/ reason) | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/reject` | Dashboard / Review / Waitlist reject cell |
| Interviewing | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/interview` | Applied dropdown |
| Offer | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/offer` | Applied dropdown |
| Withdrew | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/withdraw` | Applied dropdown |
| Not Selected (w/ reason) | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/not-selected` | Applied dropdown + reject cell |
| Promote | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/promote` | Review button |
| Reactivate | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/reactivate` | Waitlist button |
| Edit user_notes | `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/notes` | Applied notes input (800ms debounce) |

**REJECT_REASON dropdown**: 11 options (includes "Low Fit Score"). Behavior depends on STATUS:
- If STATUS = `Not Selected`: company rejection → `stage=not_selected`, NO `feedback_log`, folder stays in `_applied/` with `NOT_SELECTED_` marker file
- Otherwise: user rejection → `stage=rejected`, writes `feedback_log`, moves folder to `_rejected/`

**Stage `waitlisted`:** Set by `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/waitlist`. Folder moves to `companies/_waitlisted/`. Not a rejection — does not write to feedback_log or contaminate scorer feedback loop. When an active application at the same company is rejected/withdrawn, ntfy notification surfaces waitlisted jobs.

**Stage `not_selected`:** Set by `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/not-selected`. Only valid for post-application stages (`applied`, `interview`, `offer`); 409 otherwise. Folder stays in `companies/_applied/` with a `NOT_SELECTED_{reason}_{date}.txt` marker file. Does NOT write to `feedback_log` — company rejections must not contaminate the scorer's feedback loop. `notify_waitlist_resurface()` still fires. Appears on the Rejected Applications tab alongside user rejections.

**Stage `prep_in_progress`:** Set by `POST /board/jobs/{fp}/prep` immediately before launching `prep_application.py` as a subprocess. Prevents duplicate prep runs (handler idempotency guard + 3-job concurrency cap). Cleared to `materials_drafted` on success. `scripts/watchdog.py` rolls any job stuck > 60 min back to `scored` so the operator can re-flag.

**Health checks** (`notify.py health-check`): warns if manual_review backlog > 100, a source silently stopped producing jobs, or any target-company job scored 3–6 in last 7 days (potential mis-scores).

## Project Board — Single Source of Truth

All work is tracked on the GitHub Project board at https://github.com/users/brockamer/projects/1. **Not on the board = not on the roadmap.** No markdown tracking files, no TODO lists.

Canonical conventions live in [`docs/project-board.md`](docs/project-board.md). Read it before any work that creates, moves, or reprioritizes issues. That doc covers columns, Priority field, labels, triage checklist, and `gh project` CLI IDs.

Core rules (enforced — see the doc for detail):
- Creating an issue is **two steps**: `gh issue create` then `gh project item-add 1 --owner brockamer --url <url>`. New issues do not auto-add.
- Every open issue on the board must have **Priority** (High/Medium/Low) set.
- Speculative far-horizon ideas get the `big-idea` label and Priority: Low — keeps them on the board without cluttering the active roadmap.
- `priority: high/med/low` labels are legacy — the **Priority field** is canonical. Reconcile mismatches.
- In Progress should hold 1–3 items max. If more, focus is scattered.
- Status transitions: Backlog → Up Next → In Progress → Done. Closing an issue auto-moves to Done; verify after closing.
- Re-sync board state before changing it — other sessions may have updated it.

**When board usage evolves** (new column, new label, new workflow, new convention): update `docs/project-board.md` in the same change. The doc describes how the board actually works, not how it used to work. Behavior drifting ahead of docs is the main failure mode.

## Plan Conventions

Implementation plans live in `docs/superpowers/plans/`. Conventions are documented in [`docs/plan-conventions.md`](docs/plan-conventions.md).

**Hard requirements for every plan:**
- Numbered tasks with files, steps, verification commands, commit messages
- A **Documentation Impact** section enumerating every doc surface that needs to change (README, docs/setup/*, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, spec doc, docstrings). If none, say "None" — never omit the section
- A whole-feature verification gate distinct from per-task checks
- A self-review checklist mapping every spec section to its implementing task(s)

A plan without Documentation Impact is incomplete — push back rather than execute it.

## Release Management

Docker image releases follow [`docs/release-process.md`](docs/release-process.md). Claude owns orchestration (dogfood gate, CHANGELOG drafting, tag cut, post-tag verification, rollback); the user reviews and approves the proposed cut. The dogfood gate is a binary 48h window on `:latest` — six observable signals must all be clean before any `v*.*.*` tag is pushed. PRs containing schema/config/crontab/mount/compose-down changes get the `migration-required` label at PR-open time so that release notes surface them for external users.

## Commit Flow

This is a solo repo. Default to committing directly to `main`. Use feature branches + PRs only when the change needs the review/CI/release-notes scaffolding.

| Change type | Flow |
|-------------|------|
| Docs, board conventions, plan/spec files, jared skill tweaks, comment edits | Commit to `main` |
| Code touching pipeline behavior (scoring, fetchers, sheet sync, DB schema, LLM roles) | Feature branch → PR → merge |
| Anything qualifying for `migration-required` (schema, config, compose, crontab, mounts) | PR — release-notes workflow depends on it |

Rationale: PRs exist to gate risky changes and to give the `migration-required` → release-notes pipeline something to attach to. A board-chore or docs-tweak PR is overhead without those benefits, and unmerged PRs cause drift (forgotten branches, misleading "merged in #N" references).

When in doubt — does this change affect what users see when they pull `:latest`? If yes, PR. If no, commit to main.

## Working Style

- Terse. User reports completion of each step before asking what's next.
- Read file contents before proposing changes. Never assume files match prior discussion.
- Diagnose root cause before fixing. No shotgun solutions.
- Copy-pasteable commands only. No placeholders. Use paths from `scripts/paths.py`. Platform-aware.
- Never confuse `aichat` with `aichat-ng`. Different binaries.
- Goal: working features first, polish later.
- Preserve the scheduler-driven daily run in all changes.
