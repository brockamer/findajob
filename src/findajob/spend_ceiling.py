"""Monthly LLM spend-ceiling enforcement helpers (#671).

Two surfaces:

- :func:`check_call_gate` — called inside ``openrouter.complete()`` before
  every HTTP request. Opens a short-lived DB connection, checks the current
  calendar-month spend, and raises :class:`LLMSpendCeilingExceeded` if the
  ceiling is met or exceeded. No-op when the ceiling is disabled or the DB
  is unavailable (so unit tests that don't build a pipeline.db are unaffected).

- :func:`check_launch_gate` — called by the 5 LLM-spawning route handlers
  before they launch a subprocess. Returns a :class:`LaunchGateRefusal`
  dataclass if the ceiling is exceeded, or ``None`` if OK. Takes a caller-
  supplied ``sqlite3.Connection`` so it participates in the route's existing
  DB session.
